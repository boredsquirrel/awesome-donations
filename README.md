## Software in the public interest

[SPI](http://www.spi-inc.org/) is a non-profit organization which was 
founded to help organizations develop and distribute open hardware and 
software. We encourage programmers to use the GNU General Public License 
or other licenses that allow free redistribution and use of software, 
and hardware developers to distribute documentation that will allow 
device drivers to be written for their product.

SPI acts as a fiscal sponsor to many free and open source projects. FOSS 
projects interested in becoming associated to SPI should read the 
Associated Project HOWTO. Services offered to projects can be found 
here. The relationship between SPI and associated projects is explained 
here.
